# Calprint
## A simple calendar printout program for ics files
It displays a nice year view, optmized for printout
Usage:
- Start calprint.py
- Open: localhost:8000 (This displays the first calendar in the config file with the current year)
- Open localhost:8000?cal=nameOfCalendar&year=1980 (For specific calendar)

###
Hint: It's maybe best to keep it running inside of a VM and behind a reverse proxy since the used simple.http server is not made for production!

Beside that: have fun!
